h2. XSLT and Rails! Huzzah!

I am only being 50% sarcastic. XSLT can actually be quite useful for some situations of view generation as long as you can keep yourself from burning out on its sheer ludicrousness and/or majesty.

h2. Usage

Put it in your Gemfile, and then create an @app/transforms@ directory. Write an XSLT stylesheet in there; you can use Haml if you want, or just raw XML.

The name of the file is important; it describes what sort of stuff it transforms from and to. In the simplest case, to transform some XML with a root tag named @report@ into HTML, your transform might be named @report.html.xslt@ (or if it's written in Haml, then @report.html.xslt.haml@).

Here's a simple example `report.html.xslt.haml`:

<pre>
<code>
!!! XML
%xsl:stylesheet(version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform")
  
%xsl:template(match="/env/context")
  -# More about this later, for now just ignore the context tag

%xsl:template(match="/env/report")
  %h1 I am a report! Hey, check me out!
  %ul
    %xsl:apply-templates(select=".")

%xsl:template(match="report-item")
  %li
    %label
      %xsl:value-of(select="@name")
    %xsl:value-of(select=".")
</code>
</pre>
